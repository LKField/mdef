## Tandem Interview - Carlos 

Before starting to interview [Carlos](https://carlossilveiradesign.gitbook.io/mdef-diary){:target="_blank"} about his projects, I had an idea of his project but was interested in learning more about the scale and scope of impact he is trying to make. I know he is interested in health care and soft robotics and likely eventually will want to start a company. Therefore, the questions I asked were about the scale of impact he wants to have and the specific goals he has for himself. 

!!! question 
    - What is the area of impact that you are interested in?
    - Do you have a particular alternative present you are going to try to move towards with your interventions? 
    - What is your end goal for the projects? Long term and at the end of this course. 
    - Is there any important information we have not yet covered?

After the interview, I think a question I would have liked to ask is about which skills he is interested in developing further in this course. He touched on it a bit, but I think that I could have dug deeper on the specific things he needs to learn to reach his goals. I think this would have been a valuable line of questioning. 


## Tandem Interview - Reflection 

After Carlos interviewed me, I felt I had a bit more clear idea of my narrative because he asked a challenging question that I have been struggling with. The question was essentially "how do all your different interests and interventions connect?" 

The answer I was able to provide was that I am thinking about repair from many different perspectives and trying to open up black boxes to allow people to understand their objects and the systems they are subject to.
