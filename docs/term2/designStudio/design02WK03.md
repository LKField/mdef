!!! quote "Present Continuity"
        
    Users of internet platforms like myself are inundated with information fed to us by algorithms that we cannot see or understand. These algorithms influence how we think, what we value, and how we spend our time and money. We are often not aware of where these influences come from and have little power to fight back against these filter bubbles which may not truly reflect our own values, but instead come from the external influence of our algorithms. The algorithms hold us in thought patterns and social circles that further validate our current beliefs, creating a polarized world where we unquestioningly believe propaganda and are unwilling to engage with ideas that differ from our own. 


!!! quote "Alternative Present"

    Users of internet platforms like myself are able to directly influence what information is shown to us by hacking our algorithms to take back control. These hacked algorithms challenge us to examine how we think, what we value, and how we spend our time and money. We have control over what information feeds our algorithms and fight back against filter bubbles by introducing randomness and opposing views to actively challenge our beliefs and deeply examine our values. The hacked algorithms push us out of our current thought patterns, enabling us to question propaganda, and to open space for engaging in new social circles where we are empowered to have constructive conversation with people who hold beliefs different from our own.

## Reflection on Toni Navarro Talk 

1. Evaluate the following aspects in relation to your project: 
    - What assumptions –about goodness, justice, society…– are implicit in its conception (meta-ethics)? 
    - What guidelines or norms should be followed during its development (normative ethics)? 
    - What criteria could be established to assess its consequences, and what protocols would you apply in case of negative outcomes (applied ethics)?
	
2. Design is "a material way of doing ethics" that must anticipate the trajectories of its products. Imagine a possible scenario that reflects the ideal application of your project: 
    - How are your intentions and values embedded or inscribed in it? 
    - What factors could cause a deviation in the context of use?

3. What mechanisms of evaluation and participation could help democratize your design process by making it more transparent, collaborative, and accountable? How can situated knowledge and marginalized communities be included to take their interests and needs into account?

4. Non-human agency compels us to adopt a more humble position as designers, moving away from modern fantasies of total control. What degree of autonomy do you attribute to the material and technical components of your project? Identify the "actants" or "cognizers" at play, their differentiated responsibilities and specific roles.
