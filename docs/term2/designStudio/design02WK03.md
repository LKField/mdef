## Situated Intervention 



## Reflection on Toni Navarro Talk 

1. Evaluate the following aspects in relation to your project: 
    - What assumptions –about goodness, justice, society…– are implicit in its conception (meta-ethics)? 
    - What guidelines or norms should be followed during its development (normative ethics)? 
    - What criteria could be established to assess its consequences, and what protocols would you apply in case of negative outcomes (applied ethics)?
	
2. Design is "a material way of doing ethics" that must anticipate the trajectories of its products. Imagine a possible scenario that reflects the ideal application of your project: 
    - How are your intentions and values embedded or inscribed in it? 
    - What factors could cause a deviation in the context of use?

3. What mechanisms of evaluation and participation could help democratize your design process by making it more transparent, collaborative, and accountable? How can situated knowledge and marginalized communities be included to take their interests and needs into account?

4. Non-human agency compels us to adopt a more humble position as designers, moving away from modern fantasies of total control. What degree of autonomy do you attribute to the material and technical components of your project? Identify the "actants" or "cognizers" at play, their differentiated responsibilities and specific roles.
