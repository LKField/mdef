## Design Space

<br>

The style of my design space changed when I was preparing for the Design Dialogue. My intention with this representation of my work was to more directly show the work I have done and to demonstrate how it all relates. While I think including projects that inspire me and my design practice in this space is helpful, I found that my design space was getting too overwhelming, so by scaling it down to projects or content I am doing or directly consuming, I hope it has become less overwhelming. 

In the iteration I now have at the start of the second term, I have included the projects I intend to do, the areas I want to explore, and some initial communities and people I want to reach out to and try to include in my practice. I hope this is a clearer representation of my practice than the previous versions were.
