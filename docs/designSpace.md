    The first design space I made was from the series of objects/photos I brought in as part of our assignment. It was a bit of a mess of ideas, connections, and lots of ripped up paper.

    The second design space reused a lot of the objects/photos I had in the previous one, but also employed the help of the t-shirt quilt I made in 2016 before I went off to college as a backdrop which could be a bit more permanent than the thin paper we had in class. 

    Additionally, this Design Space included some of the cards from the Atlas of Weak Signals.

    The third design space is a the same as the second design space with a few elements added digitally because I have not printed new additional images or found a more permanent solution for maintaining the design space yet. It is a work in progress and I am sure it will continue to change.

    The blanket I was using as the backdrop of my physical design space ended up needing to be on my bed as the weather is getting colder. So, I finally decided to convert my physical design space to a digital one. While the physical version felt more tactile, more me, it has also gotten stale. Having it up on the wall, hard to reach without a stool made it challenging to update it. Additionally, having to print photos of things I wanted to add to it made it challenging. So, I am in the process of converting my space to a digital one. It is still a work in progress. There are a lot of things from the physical one that have not made it onto the digital one yet. I hope to fix this soon, and will continue to build it out, making connections, sharing insights, adding projects.
