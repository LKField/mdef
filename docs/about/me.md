# About Me 

![Headshot](../images/headshots/Doune.jpeg){ align=left width="45%"}

My name is Lucretia Field and I have loved to create all sorts of things for as long as I can remember. 

I studied Electrical Engineering for my undergrad degree and now I am excited to be starting the Master in Design for Emergent Futures to further my designing, prototyping, and making skills. 

I am excited to see where this journey takes me!
