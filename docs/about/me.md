# About Me

    My name is Lucretia Field and I have loved to create all sorts of things for as long as I can remember. 

    I studied Electrical Engineering for my undergrad degree at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, USA. Now I am excited to be starting the Master in Design for Emergent Futures to further my designing, prototyping, and making skills and to figure out more clearly what my next steps are going to be. 

    I am excited to see where this journey takes me!
