# What am I reading this term? 

I have come to realize that there is a lot of unassigned content I would like to consume this term. Many of the professors have mentioned books, articles, videos, and creators that might be of interest to check out. So, I have decided to keep a running list of what I am learning about as resources to look into for more information as the term continues.
