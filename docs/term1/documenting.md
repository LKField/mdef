## Website 

I have built a website before using Wordpress. I have even tried coding my own site with HTML and CSS although I found that process tedious and I struggled to turn the design vision I had into reality. 

For this website, I wanted to create it for free rather than having to pay a hosting fee. In class we were introduced to the idea of hosting a static site on GitHub which seemed like a good option. 

I decided I didn't like the limitations of GitBook or the other suggested options, but I liked the look of the websites from previous years that used Material for MkDocs. So, I started up my site using MkDocs and occasionally taking inspiration from the pages of students from previous years as well. 

MkDocs is relatively straightforward and easy to use because Markdown is relatively easy to understand. I have not quite figured out how to do all of the things I would like to be able to do with this site in terms of customization, but it is a good start and I am sure I will continue to learn more. 

## Documentation 

In terms of videos and photographs in the documenting process, I am getting better at remembering to take photos and videos of the work I am doing in class. I now frequently take photos even when I am not sure what exactly I am documenting.
