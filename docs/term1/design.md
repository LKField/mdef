# Design Studio 01 

Our week of Design Studio Intro began with an overview of what the Design Studio is and a list of recommendations for success in the course: 

    * Take chances
    * Knock on doors 
    * Build trust - start ASAP 
    * Connect with what you care about 
    * Small steps are best steps
    * Try and do it yourself 

I am excited to take these recommendations to heart, although I am finding myself nervous about the challenges connecting with locals will present going forward, I am working to embrace the excitement.
