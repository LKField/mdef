# Design Studio 01 - Second Session 

## Personal Intervention 


## Class Activity

For the class activity, we talked in groups about prototypes we have made in the past. Then we took our partner's prototype experiences and reconfigured them into one of the other prototype roles and made a very quick mockup using random materials we had brought from home. 


The 4 roles of prototyping that we discussed are:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-numeric-1-circle-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Role 1__

    ---

    A prototype as an experimental component to test a specific hypothesis

-   :material-numeric-2-circle-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Role 2__

    ---

    A prototype as a means of inquiry for open-ended exploration of phenomena
    
-   :material-numeric-3-circle-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Role 3__

    ---

    A prototype as an illustration or demonstration to to embody the research concept

-   :material-numeric-4-circle-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Role 4__

    ---

    Prototyping as a driver for the research direction where process is part of the prototype

My partner had been researching gig workers, specifically within the food delivery industry, and decided to sign up to deliver food for a day to learn what the process of signing up was and what a day in the life of a delivery driver would be like. This method could be fit into roles 2-4. For my prototype of another research method, I went with a more traditional method, propoding the integration of a rating system into the delivery app itself, not only for the customers, but for the "executives" (the drivers) as well. The idea is that they could rate their most recent delivery and then the data could be compared to the customer's rating, the traffic in their geographical area, the weather at the time of the rating, and perhaps other factors as well.
