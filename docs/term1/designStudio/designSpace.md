    The first design space I made was from the series of objects/photos I brought in as part of our assignment. It was a bit of a mess of ideas, connections, and lots of ripped up paper.

    The second design space reused a lot of the objects/photos I had in the previous one, but also employed the help of the t-shirt quilt I made in 2016 before I went off to college as a backdrop which could be a bit more permanent than the thin paper we had in class. 

    Additonally, this Design Space included some of the cards from the Atlas of Weak Signals.

    The third design space is a the same as the second design space with a few elements added digitally because I have not printed new additional images or found a more permanent solution for maintaining the design space yet. It is a work in progress and I am sure it will continue to change.
