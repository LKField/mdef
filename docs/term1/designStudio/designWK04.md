## Design Space Updates 

Check out my Design Space. I am in the process of turning my physical design space into a digital one so that I can more easily update it. It is still very much in process, I am sure I will continue to reorganize it and update it going forward. 

I will admit that I am missing the physical version of my design space, so it is possible that going forward, I will attempt to find a hybrid digital-physical version of this manifestation of my brain and how I see my design process in this course. For now, it is digital and will continue to be for a while.
