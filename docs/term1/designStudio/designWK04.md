## Group Intervention 

For our next collective design intervention, I switched to a different group and this time wanted to investigate the question, *"what objects do people value and why do they value them?"* 

Specifically, I am approaching this question from the angle of consumerism and wondering what items people value and are willing to repair and hold onto long term rather than replacing often. I wanted to know what things are valuable to people such that they rise above the frenzy of the consumerism fray. I was hoping to determine what makes these objects stand out as important. 

We went through many iterations of what the intervention would look like o the point where we ended up running a small discussion group that quickly go dubbed an "art therapy session".

In this intervention, the way we asked the question probably had a large impact on the answers we received, but for the most part, as I expected the things that people said they valued, formed a relationship with, things that meant something to them, were objects either related to experiences or activities, or with sentimental or emotional ties. 

Many of the responses we got had to do with the meaning of the object rather than the monetary value. Some of the answer were about age or legacy of an object, something old that ties people to another person or a different time in their personal history. This connection to memory was important for many people. Another category we found was objects related to activities, things used to make experiences happen. In some of these cases, the specific object, was not the important thing, but the experience it allowed. For some, the monetary value was important, but often even that was tied more to symbolism than the actual monetary worth of the item. Some objects were deemed too important to bring on a trans-Atlantic move to Barcelona. Some important, meaningful objects were collectively owned, such as a beach or a star-filled night sky. Because of how we framed the question, it makes sense that these were the kinds of objects people mentioned: objects that are meaningful and impactful rather then just expensive, useful, or necessities. 

I think for me, the next step in answer my questions of consumerism would be to examine how more mundane, everyday objects, the disposable ones, the unimportant ones, can start to be viewed as more valuable and worth holding onto, worth viewing with meaning and reverence. 

!!! question 
    * How can objects we view as disposable become treasured emotional objects that we treat with care and don't seek to replace or change or discard? 

Since working on this intervention and discussing the ideas I have with friends and family, both inside and outside of the program, I have even more questions along this line of thinking that I want to explore more. 

!!! question
    * Why are our materials belongings so often linked to feelings of acceptance or belonging while not owning certain things can lead to feelings of exclusion or being ostracized by those in our communities. 
    * If objects are linked to social acceptance then some more fundamental questions begin to come up: 
        * Why do people judge other's social status by the material things they show the world? 
        * Why do people exclude others based on that perceived social status from material belongings? 
        * Why do people feel they will be excluded for not having the *right* things? 
        * How can communities change to address this valuation based on ownership and display of material goods?

## Individual Intervention 

As a continuation of my first collective intervention, I wanted to test what a day without using my laptop or phone would feel like. I had many different reasons for wanting to do this, which I will attempt to summarize below: 

!!! quote ""
    * Potentially extend the life of my phone battery by at least one 24 hour period's worth of wear
    * Disconnect from surveillance systems of cellular data and WiFi 
    * Disconnect from the global network as a means of testing what a small component of degrowth/deglobalization might feel like 
    * To experience what it feels like to fully disconnect for a day
    * To examine the subconscious habits surrounding these technologies that I have integrated so seamlessly into my daily life, I probably couldn't even list them all 

In thinking through this personal intervention, I realized that there may *not have not been a single day in approximately 10 years that I have not at least once during the day touched a smartphone*. That realization felt scary and upsetting to me. Now I can say that at least once, there has been more than a 24 hour period where I did not directly use a smartphone or laptop. Somehow that feels freeing. 


More will come as I fill out the process of this intervention more and reflect more fully on the experience. 

## Design Space Updates 

Check out my Design Space. I am in the process of turning my physical design space into a digital one so that I can more easily update it. It is still very much in process, I am sure I will continue to reorganize it and update it going forward. 

I will admit that I am missing the physical version of my design space, so it is possible that going forward, I will attempt to find a hybrid digital-physical version of this manifestation of my brain and how I see my design process in this course. For now, it is digital and will continue to be for a while.
