# Reflections from Design Dialogue 


I think somewhere along the way, I lost my direction again. I think I got caught up in the deadline of the design dialogue and the exhaustion from so much energy spent thinking as part of this program. Somewhere in the past few months between sort of finding direction and now, I lost it again. 

At the design dialogue, I was challenged to explain why I had the display I had. The bows that I had made served very little purpose in the long run and the challenge I received was "why?" but with the followup question of, you made something that was recyclable into something that is not recyclable, so what was your reason? There has to have been a strong reason why I did this then. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to give one, because I had gotten wrapped up (pun not intended) in the concept I had started down, without necessarily knowing what the why was. 

So, I think going forward, I have to figure out how to find my stronger reasons, to have stronger convictions, even if I might be wrong, but be able to explain them at least. 

I need to dig deeper into my first person perspective and stop trying to lecture. This design dialogue became too much about conversations - but I wasn't even recording those conversations very well, so, how do I change that for the future? Should all the conversations be recorded and I'll have to go back through them by hand, or is there a different thing I want to get out of these dialogues? Perhaps the path I have been on is not the right one. It helps to know that now, I guess. 

But what does the next term look like now? Do I build a community, if so, how? If I am thinking of going back to the US after this program, then what is the value of building a community here? 

So, with those questions still unanswered, what are the skills I want to learn next term? 

I want to use certain fabrication tools more: 

    - CNC - learn to make bigger things - more solid things. Will need to have a reason why, or I can just make things to learn the skills 
    - Lasercut - want to learn to develop quicker and try things more quickly and modularly 
    - How the superlab runs, I want to engage more with the people who run it and learn what things they need to do. Learn how a maker space works 

Things I want to do in general: 

    - Experiment with biomaterials - ask Salvador maybe 
    - Grow plants - can we do garden things on the roof or at Valldaura - automation, can I actually use the 'Grow Organic' project experience somehow? 
    - Kombucha - with Kevin 
    - Spirulina - with Kevin?
    - Cashew cheese - with Kevin? 
    - Make a fume extractor for the classroom from an old fan in the machine paradox box 


People I want to engage with more: 
    - Fab Lab people 
        - Josep and Dani 
        - Julia and Jessica 
        - Fab City people - I want to understand this 
    - People from other programs 
        - Atticus at Valldaura 
        - Salvador in AI 



Things in general, look into existing systems and things that work, see if there are ways to learn those, use those, 'scale' them although not necessarily in a capitalistic way 

Okay, some less happy thoughts: 

Am I just too much of a follower to be good at this? 
Are my own convictions or values or ideas too nebulous? When I am trying to figure these things out, do I get too committed to a single idea because it feels real in the moment, but then I don't examine things.
Why would I make a community here if I'm just going to move? But can I afford not to? 
Do I have too much trouble following through with plans to be in charge of something like this? 


So, where am I now? 
Still annoyed about consumerism, but what right do I have to tell anyone else what to do when I'm on a high horse of superiority. Also, I'm coming from a place of privilege and while I may recognize it, I haven't done much to learn about others or give context to the questions I still have. 
In general, I still have so many questions, too many to follow up on or with. 

So, from a first person perspective, what am I interested in? 

    - I want to know what happens when we switch algorithms 
        - prototype by switching with someone you actually know - physically switch phones or youtube accounts?
        - as you use someone else's algorithm, you would be changing theirs, potentially, depending on how it works 
        - just playing certain videos on the same wifi can influence what videos get shown too - how can we play with that? 
        - but the real crux is how do you get to switch with someone hwo you don't already overlap with?
        - is there a way to see the algorithms? 

    - What data does google actually have on me, or any other big company for that matter? 
        - look into ways to get that information 
        - Why? = because it feels scary, it feels like I want to be able to wrap my head around what corporations actually know about me 
        - How are the manipulating me? And everyone else?

    - How do we actually verify things? 
        - I think this is something I have been thinking about for a while, how do we know what gets recycled or composted or anything else? 
        - How do we know our data is being used, that we're being manipulated? 

    Maybe it's less about increasing friction and more about increasing transparency and understanding? 

    - show what the impact of your Amazon purchase will actually be somehow or your query on ChatGPT or why you are being shown a specific video. What if it is less about making it harder to buy new, but instead is about making it easier to know what you are buying. Digital material passports... but here's the thing, I don't want to write code, I don't want to mess with blockchain, I want to make things with my hands, sew, sculpt, create in those ways. So... once again, I am back to where I have always been. Wanting to make changes in ways that I don't know how to and don't want to really. BLAH! ugh!
