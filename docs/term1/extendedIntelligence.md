!!! abstract "Course Details"

    **Dates:** 05 November to 07 November and 12 November to 15 November 2024

The first three days of Extended Intelligence were very challenging for me because the content of the class was fairly "doom and gloom" which may really have been a reflection of my own mental state during this week. The 2024 US election just happened and in the midst of a week talking about the detrimental side of AI and the future we are rapidly heading for, it was just too much. 

So, I have been trying to listen to more inspiring music which frames more of the approach I tried to take going into the second week of Extended Intelligences.
