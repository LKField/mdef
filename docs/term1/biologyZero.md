## Genetically Modified Organism 

I was initially very resistant to doing this assignment. I have been struggling with the ethical implications of gene editing, particularly when it involves editing other organisms where the global consequences are unknown. However, I have also been nervous about editing human genes because of the potential slippy slope towards eugenics. I do not know enough about these subjects to feel confident that my impact would be a beneficial one and not have significant and negative unforeseen consequences. 

However, for the sake of this assignment, however I have decided to approach it with the understanding that my intentions are what matter most.

I decided to look into editing the genes of the bacteria that causes Lyme Disease to be transmitted from a tick to a human. From searching on Wikipedia, I discovered that the bacteria is [*Borrelia mayonii*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrelia_mayonii){:target="_blank"}.

I received a lot of help from [Carlo Silveira](https://carlossilveiradesign.gitbook.io/mdef-diary){:target="_blank"} who talked me through a lot of the processes I would need for this project. Thank you Carlos! 

From there, I found a paper about sequencing this genome: [Whole Genome Sequence and Comparative Genomics of the Novel Lyme Borreliosis Causing Pathogen, *Borrelia mayonii*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5193363/pdf/pone.0168994.pdf){:target="_blank"} Kingry, et. al, 2016. Although my understanding of this article is very limited, I have tried to understand at least the basics of this system.
