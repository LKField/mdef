So, I finally decided to convert my physical design space to a digital one. While the physical version felt more tactile, more me, it has also gotten stale. Having it up on the wall, hard to reach without a stool made it challenging to update it. Additionally, having to print photos of things I wanted to add to it made it challenging. So, I am in the process of converting my space to a digital one. It is still a work in progress. There are a lot of things from the physical one that have not made it onto the digital one yet. I hope to fix this soon, and will continue to build it out, making connections, sharing insights, adding projects. </p> <p>Date</p> <p>24 November 2024 </p> <p></p> <p>Date</p> <p>17 December 2024 </p> <p></p> <p>Date</p> <p>20 January 2025</p> <p></p> <p>Date</p> <p>02 February 2025</p> <p></p> <p>Date</p> <p>16 February 2025</p> <p></p> <p>Date</p> <p>02 March 2025</p> <p></p> <p>Date</p> <p>28 March 2025</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"thesis/","title":"Darned Circuits","text":"<p>Dear Reader, </p> <p>Have you marveled at the amount of clothing near the trash on the ground? Have you noticed a broken television in the garbage? Have you ever picked these items up? </p> <p>I do. </p> <p>I take discarded clothing and consumer electronics and transform them into objects from another reality; where computers have cloth screens and woven trackpads and jeans have butt patches that light up. In my world, parts of different items are combined in ways that challenge the expectations of products and the way we are used to seeing them. </p> <p>In the real world, the United Nations reports that 62 billion kgs of e-waste were generated in 2022; the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that the equivalent of a truck full of clothing waste is burned or buried every second. We accept these absurdities as the cost of progress.</p> <p>Instead of throwing away our old, broken, or simply unwanted items, we need to shift collective habits to actually fix this system, reimagine our items and prolong their useful life. Community repair efforts from Restart Parties, Repair Cafes, and Mend in Public Days, to individual repair habits are a place to start addressing these practical problems and deepening our connection to the objects in our lives. However, when repair is not even an option in our collective thoughts, when we face external pressure from advertisements and social judgement, why not embrace the weird? </p> <p>Reader, what weird will you embrace? Maybe you will take pieces of a broken laptop to \u2018mend\u2019 your clothes or \u2018fix\u2019 your electronics with cloth and thread. Perhaps instead of just fixing objects, will you fix your relationship with them by transforming them into new items that break the conventions of purpose and usefulness. Or, will you try your hand at repairing your clothes in a traditional manner? Will you find a community that can help you fix your coffee machine that just stopped working? Can you keep your smartphone for just one year longer? I challenge you to begin bragging about how old your items are, because really, it\u2019s ridiculous that we don\u2019t view the longevity of our objects as a personal achievement. </p> <p>I hope you will join me in this world of Darned Circuits where I imagine an opposite extreme, and perhaps, we can start conversations with those still stuck in reality, so that we can meet in the middle to repair more. </p> \u276e \u276f"},{"location":"thesis/#horizontal-video-for-desktop-viewing","title":"Horizontal Video for Desktop Viewing","text":""},{"location":"about/me/","title":"About Me","text":"My name is Lucretia Field and I have loved to create all sorts of things for as long as I can remember.

Improve it in some way. The suggestion was to 'make it hard for yourself by making it easy for the plants'. In our group, Maria Vittoria, Auxence, and I chose a specific food garden that our group member, has a personal connection to. </p> <p>We started by asking Vitti's friend, Cristina, about the challenges she has with her garden and what methods of farming she uses. Through this discussion we learned that Cristina uses a permaculture technique where she does not till the soil to promote nutrient conservation. Some of the challenges she has include snails, insect pests, water scarcity, and downy mildew on the tomato plants. </p> <p>We initially were thinking of making suggestions about pair cropping for the tomatoes and using some prediction algorithms to determine when pests might be around. We researched potential suggestions but realized that our brief researched knowledge would be insignificant compared to Cristina's hands-on knowledge of her own garden. It felt disingenuous to make suggestions to a gardener about how she \"should\" be doing things as people with no hands-on knowledge of her garden. </p> <p>Through discussions with Jonathan, we decided to focus on the idea of community knowledge and resource sharing instead. This way farmers could talk and work directly with other farmers in their local region to share information of what is working, what challenges they are having, and potentially to share resources such as soil, seeds, or plants as well. </p> <p></p> <p>Project Proposal</p> <p>We imagined an app that would allow farmers to get hyper-local feedback and advice from other farmers in their region as well as share resources. </p> <p>The idea would be to incorporate various filters to make the app as simple as possible. Jonathan told us that many farmers he has worked with use audio messages more than typing because of dirt on their hands and the convenience of stream-of-consciousness note taking. This highlighted the need for ease of use within our proposed app. </p> <p>The app would include a chat feature for asking for advice and sharing information as well as a marketplace which would allow people to offer items they were willing to part with or to request things they needed. The app would include options of purchase like a traditional monetary exchange, exchange of goods, exchange of labor or advice, or any other user-filled option. Additionally, there would be options for delivery method such as pick-up only or delivery. </p> <p>The idea for this app would be to increase communication and collaboration between farmers, from family gardeners to industrial farmers, to plant novices to experts and to promote a culture of resource sharing. </p> <p>As Vitti said</p> <p>Another important aspect we considered is the idea of knowledge transport: finding ways to preserve and share the valuable expertise of farmers. These insights, accumulated through experience and rooted in tradition, hold immense value. By creating a tool that fosters the exchange of this expertise, we aim to empower small-scale farmers and build a stronger, more connected agricultural community</p>"},{"location":"term1/biologyZero/","title":"Biology Zero","text":"<p>Course Details</p> <p>Name: Biology Zero </p> <p>Dates: 26 November to 28 November 2024 </p> <p>Faculty: N\u00faria Conde</p> <p>Throughout this course, N\u00faria spoke a lot about climate change and the challenges we are facing as a globe. One of the points she made was about the human population on Earth and the problems global population growth will continue to create as we concentrate more and more in urban centers and use more and more of the Earth's resources. </p> <p>Additionally, a main theme of N\u00faria's lessons was the need to effectively communicate scientific research to the general public and the challenges that this presents. Translating scientific work into understandable information and then taking that information and creating actionable suggestions to inform individuals about how to make sustainable choices is a huge challenge and often leads to a disconnect between experts and the general public. </p> <p>She also explained about some of the institutional challenges scientists face when they want to share work, including the need to pay journals to publish their work. Once the work has been published, the copyright of the article belongs to the journal and the scientist cannot share free versions of their work. These kinds of gate-keeping along with private corporations (mostly US based) swooping up experienced researchers for high paid, speculative, and potentially morally questionable research is part of further challenges scientists face when trying to do research that could actually help the world. </p>"},{"location":"term1/biologyZero/#growing-things","title":"Growing Things","text":"<p>For hands-on work, we started by creating agar compounds to put in petri dishes in which to grow bacteria.

I have been struggling with the ethical implications of gene editing, particularly when it involves editing non-human organisms where the global consequences are unknown. However, I have also been nervous about editing human genes because of the potential slippy slope towards eugenics. I do not know enough about these subjects to feel confident that my impact would be a beneficial one and not have significant and negative unforeseen consequences. </p> <p>However, for the sake of this assignment, I have decided to approach it with the understanding that my intentions are what matter most. I do not intend to suggest edits that will cause new problems to pop up.</p> <p>I decided to look into editing the genes of the bacteria that causes Lyme Disease which can be transfered by a bite from a tick to a human. From searching on Wikipedia, I discovered that the bacteria is Borrelia mayonii</p> <p>I received a lot of help from Carlo Silveira who talked me through a lot of the processes I would need for this project. Thank you Carlos! </p> <p>The idea for this proposed project would essentially be to 'vaccinate' ticks against the bacteria that causes this disease. By altering the DNA sequence of the bacteria, the piece of the code that activates the bacteria could be nullified. This would then inhibit the ability of the bacteria to spread to humans through a bite. Carlos explained, using the terminology of logic gates which I understand from my background in engineering, that the function of the sequence that activates the bacterial string can be inverted with a 'not gate' . </p> <p>Carlos helped explain that the basic steps I would need to follow for this process to happen are as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Find the promoter in the Borrelia mayonii* sequence </li> <li>Invert the function of the sequence of the promoter</li> <li>Replace the previous promoter with the new one in the plasmid** </li> <li>Reinsert the plasmid into the tick for the Trojan Horse effect to take place </li> <li> <p>Observe whether the immune system of the tick recognizes or rejects the bacteria </p> <p>(* the DNA sequence that initiates the transcription of the RNA) </p> <p>(** the altered sequence which will be added to the bacteria to allow the new effect to take place)</p> </li> </ol> <p>Through my research, I found a paper about sequencing the genome of the Borrelia mayonii Whole Genome Sequence and Comparative Genomics of the Novel Lyme Borreliosis Causing Pathogen, Borrelia mayonii Kingry, et. al, 2016. Although my understanding of this article is very limited, I have tried to understand at least the basics of this system. </p> <p>The genome sequence for both the MN14-1420 and MN14-1539 strains of Borrelia mayonii can be found at this link. The idea, as explained above, would be to find the promoter in the sequence and invert the function of it. From digging through the paper, I believe the desired gene would be BB_K48 which is described as an 'immunogenic protein P37'. Since this gene dictates immune response, my understanding is that it could be altered to reverse the function of the immune response elicited by the body from this bacteria.</p> <p>Since this research is targeted at laying the groundwork for a potential vaccine, I attempted to understand the Results and Discussion sections of the paper, however I will admit to understanding very little of what was said. Therefore, I think I will leave the rest of this speculation and research to the professionals who understand these things much better than I ever could. </p>"},{"location":"term1/digfab/","title":"Fundamentals of Digital Fabrication","text":"<p>Course Details</p> <p>Name: Fundamentals of Digital Fabrication  </p> <p>Faculty: D\u00eddac Torrent, Santiago Fuentemilla Garriga, Daniel Mateos, Josep Marti Elias, &amp; Adai Surinach</p>"},{"location":"term1/digfab/#session-01","title":"Session 01","text":"<p>Session 1</p> <p>08 October 2024: Introduction to the course</p> <p>Here is where I will document my work in the Fundamentals of Digital Design class.

Gust suggested that our perception of time has become distorted by the acceleration of technological change. The distortion of time then pushes social change at a rapid pace, which in turn speeds up the pace of life, which then pushes technological change even harder. This acceleration not only causes whiplash and backlash, but simultaneously makes us feel as if we are frozen, stuck in a time without control. </p> <p>How is your relationship with time?  - Gustavo Nogueira</p> <p>I imagine that Gust's talk was intended to be inspirational, to provide a different context for us to view the change we see happening around us. He asked us to check in with ourselves and to contextualize our own experience of time. He asked us to approach the past with gratitude and to focus on resiliency in the face of change. Unfortunately, given the context of my week, I found these ideas really challenging to hold on to. The immediacy of crisis tends to narrow the vision and while I agree that stepping back is helpful, for me, in that week, it was simply too soon. Which perhaps was exactly the point he was trying to make. </p> <p>What if the way we respond to the crisis is part of the crisis?  - Gustavo Nogueira</p> <p>That evening, I watched Coded Bias, a documentary by Joy Buolamwini about bias within facial recognition systems and the use of these systems in surveillance. I found it terrifying and upsetting, but also motivating. By exposing the severity of the problems, it fuels resistance and potentially a push back against these systems. For some reason, watching this was enough to push me, at least partially, out of my state of paralyzing fear and frustration. </p> <p>Back in class, we moved into talking about ethical and environmental impacts of increasing the use of AI Systems and the ever expanding infrastructure needed to maintain systems that we are becoming more and more dependent on. </p>"},{"location":"term1/extendedIntelligence/#the-5-1-critical-data-center-studies","title":"The 5 (+1) Critical Data Center Studies:","text":"<ul> <li> <p> Earth</p> <p>The physical infrastructure of these places, the logistical networks they require, and the materials extracted from the Earth have huge impacts on Earth. </p> </li> <li> <p> Water</p> <p>The water required for the entire life cycle of a data center (from the microchip manufacturing to the cooling of the massive structures) is staggering. </p> </li> <li> <p> Labor</p> <p>The cost to people, through exploitation of low income workers moderating content or creating datasets for training, of these systems is an often hidden piece of the AI puzzle.</p> </li> <li> <p> Energy</p> <p>The energy required to run these data centers is also overwhelmingly huge and hidden from view of those who use these services. </p> </li> <li> <p> Heat</p> <p>The heat produced by this infrastructure is it's own problem as well, leading to fires and impacts on local climates around the centers.</p> </li> <li> <p> Waste</p> <p>The end of the life cycle of electronics is e-waste processing and the harm to the Earth and people involved in this processing is also overwhelming. </p> </li> </ul> <p>At the end of week one, we finally had a moment of hope when we were told what our project for the next week would be: to use AI to create a Design Fiction Artifact that would help MDEF students in an idealized Solar Punk world of 2044.  </p> <p>Design Fiction</p> <p>The practice of creating tangible and evocative prototypes from possible futures, to help discover and represent the consequences of decision making</p> <p>Source: Near Future Laboratory</p>"},{"location":"term1/extendedIntelligence/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":"<p>Throughout the week, I kept finding myself more and more frustrated by the increasing reliance on AI and feeling superior that I \"don't use it\". The reality is that even if I have never made a ChatGPT querrie, and only once generated an image using MidJourney, I use these systems all the time. It is impossible to escape them, and if I am being honest, there is a lot of benefit to some of the uses of these systems. Additionally, I have privileges that have allowed me to stand on this moral high ground that I place myself on in terms of not using these tools. I learned English as my first language and therefore do not need to use ChatGPT to translate my thoughts into words I can put on this webpage. I had exposure to drawing skills as a young kid and learned, at least to some extent, how to turn ideas in my head into drawn pictures, so while I do not always have the time to create the art I envision, I can avoid using image generation AI and still mostly achieve the kinds of creative expression I want to. I am sure there are many other positions of privilege I do not yet recognize that allow me to hold my ground on this refusal to progress into the modern world. </p> <p>I think this week, while challenging personally and emotionally, reminded me why I take the stance I do, but also gently suggested that I need not be so rigid in that stance. The reality is these systems exist, many are beneficial, many are harmful, all of it must be viewed in context and with care. AI is a system made by humans, humans have bias and prejudices, AI therefore will reflect those ugly pieces of humanity unless we find a way to teach it to transcend our limitations.

We need to find ways to remove our encoded biases from their trainings and we need to learn to honor the resources we are using and restrain our consumption to avoid unnecessary waste. Artificial Intelligence is not bad or evil as I have often joked, it simply amplifies the bad and evil instincts within our society. It makes it easier than ever to profile others, to discriminate, to divide, to consume, and produce. Perhaps, with time, as Gustavo suggested, we will see the pendulum swing back. Perhaps if we stop and reflect, step back, we can encode these systems with more fair and equitable 'values' than the ones we ourselves have. </p> <p>I will continue to not use ChatGPT and may request that my face not be scanned the next time I go to an airport.

This clunky connection method probably seemed like a good idea when it was designed, or it was chosen as part of a 'design for obsolescence' scheme, but in trying to hack the device, not having an audio jack made it difficult. </p> <p></p> <p>We also noticed a few design choices that were part of the Design for Manufacturing process. For example, the Wifi PCB had many spaced for chips that were unpopulated.

I was primarily thinking then, about systems and larger scale things and reflecting that while a small subset of experts may know how these things work, there is no one person who understands what is behind every curtain of every modern convenience we have. No one single person understands how everything works. Even experts at understanding large systems may completely miss the minutia of how smaller components or pieces of things work. </p> <p>This exercise in taking apart obsolete electronics scratched a bit of that itch to understand. It shined a light on some of the systems in place that allow consumer electronics to be manufactured at high volume and low cost because of shortcuts within the design process. It was a good reminder that simple designs are easier to work with, to understand, to fix, but simple is not always what the industry wants to see. 'Straightforward' is not always easiest when it comes to mass production. The number of people, machines, and processes involved in creating the speaker must be staggering, and so few people ever even see inside the object that was created for the purpose of bringing music and entertainment into people's homes. </p>"},{"location":"term1/machineParadox/#week-two-almost-useless-machine","title":"Week Two: Almost Useless Machine","text":"<p>The next week was about taking our objects and reconfiguring them into new objects that are 'almost useless' machines.

So, my prosthetic for influencing how I was judged was a few pieces of paper: four with personal information like my name, date of birth, former and current addresses, phone numbers, and websites and social media and six blank templates for receipts. I figured that giving out information that is essentially public information in exchange for things that might traditionally be exchanged for money wouldn't work so well when making exchanges with individuals. Corporations who have ways to do things with that information will happily exchange their services for details about ourselves, but individuals don't tend to have much need for that kind of information.

Additionally, I have been feeling stuck in my head about a lot of the projects for this course as well as getting bogged down in to-do lists and overthinking. In this way, I think this week was very useful at breaking down my inhibitions and forcing me to act without thinking in a valuable way. I think it is ironic that in my brainstorm notes for how I wanted to be judged, I included wanting to be seen 'as someone who acts on instinct/without overthinking' and yet I had a page full of many notes that could easily be considered overthinking. This week, the speed with which we were expected to prototype required getting out of my head and just starting, just creating.</p> <p>The name of this week's course, \"Living with your own ideas\" somehow feels ironic in that sense, because it is my ideas that often seem to hold me back. I get so in my own head about thinking through processes, trying to determine the best way to approach things, that I struggle to dive in and commit to actually doing. So, in some ways, I almost felt that this week was about \"Living beyond your ideas\" in the sense that it challenged me to stop thinking in the moment, but just to create what felt right. Then I was able to go back and consider what I had done, what I had learned, and how I could potentially improve or at least grow from these insights. </p> <p>The process of creating prosthetics, even if I am still struggling to view them as prosthetics because of my preconceived idea of what that word means, challenged me to think about the ways I already use tools and objects beyond my body to alter how I experience the world or how the world experiences me. </p> <p>I have actually used my first prosthetic a few times since I made it. It doesn't work especially well, but at moments when things in my peripheral vision become distracting, it has been momentarily helpful to refocus my attention, blocking things beyond where I want my focus to be in a given moment. Additionally, my choice of how I wanted to be judged has led me to many interesting conversations with people both inside and outside of my program about the semantics of 'commodity', access to data and personal information, and has reminded me that often times, asking for things, even if it feels like a silly or unreasonable request, can lead to interesting and exciting outcomes. </p>"},{"location":"term1/withOthers/","title":"Design With Others","text":"<p>Course Details</p> <p>Name: Design With Others</p> <p>Dates: 19 November to 22 November 2024 </p> <p>Faculty: Laura Ben\u00edtez &amp; many guests </p> <p>Design with Others was a session led by Laura Ben\u00edtez about the concept of 'othering' and how this impacts design, but also about how we can potentially use different models of living and designing to enrich our practices and lives. </p>"},{"location":"term1/withOthers/#dr-marta-delatte","title":"Dr. Marta Delatte","text":"<p>The first day, we had a guest lecture from Dr. Marta Delatte entitled \"How to do things with Design Justice\". She spoke about inclusivity and representation within the modern structure of our world. </p> <p>Quote</p> <p>Good intentions does not always equal good design and is not an excuse for falling short  - Dr. Marta Delatte </p> <p>She spoke about the problems of data extraction; turning the nuance of identity into data, creating a mechanical process by which we claim to know a population, a culture, an individual. The consequences of this practice is often the reinforcing of existing unjust power dynamics. Accountability, she suggested, needs to not only come at the end of a design process, but should be laced throughout the process, holding space to actually listen to the voices of those most impacted by the decisions being made. </p> <p>Quote</p> <p>How can we take the question, What does this represent? and turn it into What is this doing with us, to us, and how are we responding?  - Dr. Marta Dellate </p> <p>Dr. Delatte then introduced the idea of the Matrix of Domination, a framework developed by Patricia Hill Collins for examining oppression and privilege in a wholistic way. </p> <ul> <li> <p> Structural Domain</p> <p>Represents power embedded in institutions (law, politics, religion, and economics).</p> </li> <li> <p> Disciplinary Domain</p> <p>Focuses on bureaucratic control mechanisms, including rules and regulations that dictate behavior.</p> </li> <li> <p> Hegemonic Domain</p> <p>Relates to cultural ideologies and norms, shaping how people think about societal values.</p> </li> <li> <p> Interpersonal Domain</p> <p>Examines personal relationships and micro-level interactions that reflect broader power structures. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Her lecture continued by speaking about her research into Wikipedia articles. She shared statistics on the gender breakdown of biographical articles on Wikipedia. According to this Wikipedia article, (and yes I do realize both the irony and the beauty of using Wikipedia to check Wikipedia), as of 2023, only 19.65% of all biographies on Wikipedia were about women. Dr. Delatte shared a similar statistic and included that less than 1% of the articles were about non-binary people as well. </p> <p>Quote</p> <p>What has encyclopedic worth? - Dr. Marta Delatte </p> <p>I found her material interesting, it was a good introduction to the idea of designing with others, however, it also left me with some significant questions. </p> <p>Question</p> <ul> <li>Is the term 'feminism' no longer a useful term to use in discussion about much needed change in the way modern, western society is structured? Those in favor of feminist methodologies profess that includes men in the scope of needed change, but I have to wonder, in the face of significant division and hurt around questions of equality, does this term which has a complicated history cause more pain than is helpful or necessary. Does the term, which claims to include men in an enlightened vision for the world, in fact alienate potential allies enough that it is no longer a constructive term to use in discourse? </li> <li>What does a fully inclusive future look like? At what point does inclusivity become so granular that it loses its meaning and potency? </li> <li>Is the structure of social media we have perpetuating 'othering' or does it provide a space for those who have been othered to see themselves represented? Do the bubbles we have on social media help us feel safe and seen or just create more division without the possibility of discourse in disagreement? Is social media the modern version of human zoos where we can go and gawk at those who are different from us or a means of liberating and connecting those who have lived in shadows, or perhaps both? </li> </ul>"},{"location":"term1/withOthers/#eemeemee","title":"eemeemee","text":"<p>The next day of Design with Others, we started out class with a lecture from Laura.

I think I got caught up in the deadline of the design dialogue and the exhaustion from so much energy spent thinking as part of this program. Somewhere in the past few months between sort of finding direction and now, I lost it again. </p> <p>At the design dialogue, I was challenged to explain why I had the display I had. The bows that I had made served very little purpose in the long run and the challenge I received was \"why?\" but with the followup question of, you made something that was recyclable into something that is not recyclable, so what was your reason? There has to have been a strong reason why I did this then. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to give one, because I had gotten wrapped up (pun not intended) in the concept I had started down, without necessarily knowing what the why was. </p> <p>So, I think going forward, I have to figure out how to find my stronger reasons, to have stronger convictions, even if I might be wrong, but be able to explain them at least. </p> <p>I need to dig deeper into my first person perspective and stop trying to lecture. This design dialogue became too much about conversations - but I wasn't even recording those conversations very well, so, how do I change that for the future? Should all the conversations be recorded and I'll have to go back through them by hand, or is there a different thing I want to get out of these dialogues? Perhaps the path I have been on is not the right one. It helps to know that now, I guess. </p> <p>But what does the next term look like now? Do I build a community, if so, how? If I am thinking of going back to the US after this program, then what is the value of building a community here? </p> <p>So, with those questions still unanswered, what are the skills I want to learn next term? </p> <p>I want to use certain fabrication tools more: </p> <pre><code>- CNC - learn to make bigger things - more solid things. Will need to have a reason why, or I can just make things to learn the skills \n- Lasercut - want to learn to develop quicker and try things more quickly and modularly \n- How the superlab runs, I want to engage more with the people who run it and learn what things they need to do. Learn how a maker space works\n</code></pre> <p>Things I want to do in general: </p> <pre><code>- Experiment with biomaterials - ask Salvador maybe \n- Grow plants - can we do garden things on the roof or at Valldaura - automation, can I actually use the 'Grow Organic' project experience somehow? \n- Kombucha - with Kevin \n- Spirulina - with Kevin?\n- Cashew cheese - with Kevin? \n- Make a fume extractor for the classroom from an old fan in the machine paradox box\n</code></pre> <p>People I want to engage with more:      - Fab Lab people          - Josep and Dani          - Julia and Jessica          - Fab City people - I want to understand this      - People from other programs          - Atticus at Valldaura          - Salvador in AI </p> <p>Things in general, look into existing systems and things that work, see if there are ways to learn those, use those, 'scale' them although not necessarily in a capitalistic way </p> <p>Okay, some less happy thoughts: </p> <p>Am I just too much of a follower to be good at this?

I traveled for nearly 4 months with only a 35L backpack full of clothes and while I got sick of the few clothing items I had with me, I managed to do it without much difficulty.</p> <p>So, what do I actually own? How long have I owned what I have? How much of what I own was acquired new versus second hand? How many of my clothes have been altered or repaired versus what remains unchanged?

I learned that I only brought about 25% of my clothes to Barcelona. I learned that I left most of the oldest clothes I own - from when I was 16 or 17 years old - at home and that what I brought to Barcelona tend to be newer pieces of clothing. It was also very telling that for around 25% of my clothing I could not figure out what year I acquired it in. Some of the years were estimations based on which stage of my life I was in when I acquired them (high school, college, post-college). </p> <p>Overall, I think this kind of analysis gave me good insight into the reality of what is in my closet and highlighted my relationship with fast fashion, which I still think is fairly minimal, but perhaps not as small as I had expected.</p>"},{"location":"term1/designStudio/designWK02/#class-activity","title":"Class Activity","text":"<p>For the class activity, we talked in groups about prototypes we have made in the past.

From there we came up with an idea to try to test out methods of making my 2019 iPhone 11's battery last longer. I have been thinking of getting a new phone because this one is old, with a battery that runs down very quickly. However, I don't want to buy a new phone. I don't want to spend the money, I don't want to contribute more to the environment impact of of phone, and if I am being honest, because I like the feeling of proving that I can do it. </p> <p> </p> <p>I have been thinking a lot about this graphic at an exhibit in Washington, DC in May. While it doesn't have a source to fact check it, I think the general concept feels accurate even if the number is not substantiated. So, it has become my personal goal to keep my phone, ideally one year past the point when I first started thinking I might need to replace it, which was before I moved to Barcelona to start this program. My logic was that if my phone stopped being functional while I was over here, it would complicate the progress of getting a new one because it may be somewhat challenging to get it to talk to a US network once I went home. However, now my goal is instead, to make this phone last at least through the end of this program. </p> <p>So, after all our discussions about retrofitting technology, alternative sources of energy, and examining habits, our group decided to all examine and test our relationship with our phone batteries by trying different strategies to make the daily battery last longer then it normally does. We would use this as a chance to explore our relationship with our devices and then also would attempt to make a solar charging system for my phone so that I could test what it would be like to power my phone only off of 'renewable' resources. </p>"},{"location":"term1/designStudio/designWK03/#group-design-intervention","title":"Group Design Intervention","text":""},{"location":"term1/designStudio/designWK03/#my-experience","title":"My experience","text":"<p>The initial idea of adding a solar panel to my 2019 iPhone 11 with a Maximum Battery Capacity of 73% sounded like an interesting technical challenge. However, in my design review with Sa\u00fal, he suggested attempting other ways to make my phone battery last longer between recharges. I decided to set up some automations in the Shortcuts app that would hopefully extend the time required between recharges even longer than the solar panel concept would. </p> <p> </p> <p>I already had an automation activated on my phone to turn on Low Battery Mode when it is disconnected from power. I made another automation to turn off Cellular Data automatically when I am am on Wifi and turn them back on when I leave Wifi. An additional automation I created was \"Extreme Battery Save Mode\" the intention was to activate this during class when I didn't want to be distracted by my phone anyway. This mode would turn off Cellular Data and Bluetooth, turn the screen to black and white mode, and dim the brightness to the minimum. I would like to have been able to close all apps that were open in the background as well, but I didn't figure out how to do that yet. </p> <p>One of the biggest draws on my battery has been \"No Cell Coverage\" which I think is because I still have my number from the USA activated. I data roaming turned off for that line, but when I turn off the line in general, my phone says that this number will be removed from my device. I do not want to remove my old phone number from my phone because it is still what I use for Wifi calling and iMessage. I intend to do more research on this and see if there is a way to force my phone to stop looking for towers that are not there. </p> <p>In terms of talking about habits, this certainly kept me from engaging with my phone as much during class time, which is valuable not only for my battery, but also means I was more engaged with the class. I did notice that during my time trying to make my battery last longer, I ended up using my laptop for more things. I did video calls to friends and family back home on my laptop rather than on my phone. So, in terms of reducing my energy consumption, I am not sure how much this helped. However, it was interesting to see my habits change. </p> <p>I did not manage to make it a full 24 hours without charging my phone because of a few different factors. </p> <pre><code>1. Habit\n2. My phone is my morning alarm \n3. Discomfort\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>If I acquired an external alarm clock so that I wasn't worried about my phone dying and missing my morning plans, I would be more willing to try not charging my phone every night. That may be the next step in my personal exploration of my relationship with my phone. At some point, I want to try going 24 hours without touching anything connected to the internet to examine my habits around being constantly connected. This experiment could potentially coincide with a period of time where I let me battery run down completely without rushing to recharge it.  </p> <p>It took a while for me to get the shortcuts set up how I wanted them to work. So, I really only spent two days actively trying to reduce the battery usage of my phone. I intend to keep up this attempt going forward, but want to make sure it is sustainable, and therefore I will give myself Saturdays to not worry about screen time or battery usage. Therefore, this battery usage graph shows a fairly successful attempt on Wednesday and Thursday. On Friday, I was using my phone for documentation of the project, which I believe made the battery usage go up further. I am excited to keep trying to change my habits with my phone. To disengage more actively while also helping preserve the battery life so that I can keep this nearly 5 year old phone for at least another year. </p>"},{"location":"term1/designStudio/designWK03/#design-space-updates","title":"Design Space Updates","text":"<p>Check out my Design Space.

This crisis on its own would be enough to make anyone lose hope, but it has fueled and is fueled by other crises like global conflicts, resource and economic inequality, loss of local community support, and a collective focus on simultaneously numbing ourselves to the suffering while constantly being bombarded with information specifically chosen by algorithms to keep us in a state of panic, fear, and division.

Having not come from a formal design education background, I don't I have as strong a bias towards the centralized, elite view of design. I have had the privilege in my various design related practices of being able to participate in creative commons and open source initiatives, so these concepts were not new to me. </p> <p></p> <p>I am excited to learn more about how to actually put them into practice more broadly in my life even outside of design. Distributed and openly shared knowledge and resources seems to me like the only logical way for humanity to continue existing in the future and it blows my mind a bit that it isn't already the universal norm. I think part of this, though is because it is really hard and often seems to work best at small scales, in local contexts. Therefore, I think in my practice in general in MDEF, I have been moving more and more towards the idea of looking and working hyper-local. Not necessarily physically local, but my situated practices have to come from a first person perspective and involve communities I am a part of because I feel that these sorts of collective practices only work when there are shared values, as we discussed in class, and those values can be really hard to maintain across large, complex groups.

The idea is to create a semi-formal space where we as students can offer our skills to other students in a more concrete way than the current methods we have of doing this allow. While I do not know if this will happen, I was inspired by the conversations we had about it and appreciated the spirit of the idea even if the reality of creating a time for each of us to lead a small workshop on one of our skills never actually happens. I think this type of project ties nicely into how I want to approach my MDEF project and life in general. Exchanges of skills, knowledge, and resources not linked to monetary compensation, but more about creating a richer life and world through shared experiences and learned skills. </p> <p>I also recognize that a project like this comes with challenges and so, as always with these idealized scenarios, I struggle to reconcile the version in my head with what might be a more realistic outcome. I feel that the examples shown in this class about that work, help keep me hopeful that these sorts of futures are possible for myself knowing that they require work, buy-in, clear expectations and management systems, and may often not run smoothly even with all that in place.

Most of these communities have codes of conduct and or community guidelines that are compulsory to follow to be part of the group. Often they have moderators who are sometimes both human and bot. I have not participated as much in these communities as I would like because I still find online spaces with strangers to be intimidating, but after this class, I may try to engage a bit more with them because I can recognize what a valuable resource they can be for information and support.

The setting is a city sidewalk featuring an amalgamation of modern and classical European buildings. Three people are interacting near a large, featureless white door. The first person, a Caucasian man with curly hair, clad in a cozy grey sweater, casually holds the door. An East-Asian woman in a black sweatshirt, wearing glasses with a friendly expression, stands in the centre, making eye contact with the man. On the right, a Middle-Eastern woman with long dark hair, clothed in a dark outfit which could be a long coat or a dress, appears to be observing this exchange. The sidewalk is decorated with patterned tiles and a leafless tree indicating a chilling winter season. Adding more context to the setting, are recycling bins, in yellow and green, demonstrating sustainability. The sky lends a muted illumination to the scene, thanks to its overcast nature, encapsulating this charming city interaction.</p>"},{"location":"term2/extended/#coffee-shop-image","title":"Coffee Shop Image","text":"<p>With our edits of the next photo, we tried to make the coffee shop look old, apocalyptic, or dystopian.

By the end of the seminar, we had simplified our idea so much that I found myself frustrated by the fact that if we had just written the code using traditional coding methods, we would have achieved our project goal better than we were ever able to get the AI to do. However, I understand that this was not the purpose of the assignment and so while the results were not exactly what we had hoped, they technically used the AI, which was ultimately the purpose of the project. </p> <p>We had an issue where the Barduino kept rebooting itself after running the AI prompt once, we never did figure out why that was, but it rebooted pretty quickly, so we just worked with it.</p> <p>The functionality we were able to achieve was that the AI system would choose a mood based on the light level and play the corresponding sound, however it proceeded to play all of the subsequent tones as well. Basically if we covered the sensor, it would choose a \"sad\" or \"gloomy\" function but then it would play \"neutral\", \"happy\", and \"excited\" after. If it just chose \"happy\" it would follow that with \"excited\". We tried many different prompts in an attempt to get it to call just one of the functions, however it never seemed to work. We also tried simplifying the prompt to make it maybe clearer to the device. This also didn't seem to work. </p> <p></p> <p>Last prompt we tried:</p> <p>Goal: Begin by reading the current light level from the light sensor. The brightest light is a value of 4095, the middle light is a value of 2095, and the darkest light is a value of 10. A higher light value is happier, a middle light value is neutral, while a lower light value is sadder. Do not play more than one melody, select only the single corresponding melody. Then play only the one melody that corresponds to the current mood of the room that you determined from reading the light sensor value.</p> <p>As someone with experience in coding, I did much of the coding itself and maintained the GitHub repository for the project as well. David and Ziming were helpful with ideation, suggesting prompts and changes to our functions, and tested the code on their own Barduinos to try out different prompts. </p> <p>Something I did learn in this process, though, was how to create an arduino_secrets.h file so that we could hide the API key while pushing to GitHub. While I have done a similar thing in python before, this was the first time I did it with Arduino and it was useful to learn to do that.

I think given more time and perhaps some more individual attention from Chris and Pietro to help explain the code to us, we maybe could have gotten it working correctly. However, because we had to simplify our idea so much to get it to even do something close to what we did, I felt like we could have just used traditional coding methods such as setting thresholds and playing the corresponding melody. </p> <p>We had ambitions to connect the Barduino to the Spotify API to have the AI system make a playlist based on the mood of the room, but considering we had only a few days and couldn't get even a \"hello world\" program working the way we wanted, that proved to be too ambitious for the time we had. I think the challenge I had personally with this project was that I do not understand if our problem was with our code or the prompt. I think by turning over the control to the AI system, we removed the clarity of what was happening. We gave up our agency and thus were unable to figure out what was happening or how to fix it. </p> <p>Unfortunately, I found it really frustrating that we were unable to get it functioning the way we wanted. During MDEF seminars in general, it often feels like they are so rushed that we don't have time or the resources available to actually finish any of the projects we start. This has been bothering me for a while and unfortunately this seminar was another time where that happened. I would like to get it working so that I could feel like I had at least a very basic application 'complete' and so that I could understand why it wasn't working before, however because of how quick these seminars are and how packed our schedule is, I don't think I will have the time nor resources to do that and so I find myself with another unfinished project and the frustration about that. </p> <p>So, while I think perhaps one day I might find this kind of technology useful, for now I remain skeptical and unfortunately a bit disappointed in myself and with the course. I understand very well how complicated coding is, but at least when it is code I am writing myself or with a group, I can understand what it is doing and even though I often encounter many problems, I know that the problem is mine and I know I just need to search for the issue.

Since the amount of time we had to register the data was very limited, a function of the size of the window we had for visualization, I struggled to time the dancing with the music and with the data recording. This challenge made the dancer part of my brain very uncomfortable as I tried to fit the dances into a context that did not work for them. Additionally, dancing in a room full of people who did not have the context for what I was doing made me a bit anxious which influenced how I was dancing. The final observation I made was that by visualizing my steps, I opened myself up in a way that felt extremely personal and a bit uncomfortable. When I shared the videos and visualizations with some dance friends, I found it interesting to observe my own response to sharing the videos. I felt self conscious about my dancing skills with the context of them being able to see somewhat quantitative data about how I was dancing.

While I do not necessarily know if it has an application outside of being kind of cool, I enjoyed the challenge of it and would like to make it more visually interesting. Another potential use for this kind of information would be analyzing patterns within the pressure in a more quantitative way. The suggestion was made during our presentation that we could apply machine learning algorithms to the data to help identify patterns. I am hesitant to do this because the sensors are not the most consistent and I would worry that by applying more 'scientific' analysis to the pressure certain conclusions would be drawn based on unreliable data. However, I think this is a potentially interesting line of investigation to follow, given certain precautions about making quantitative assumptions from somewhat subjective data. </p>"},{"location":"term2/hnmi/#resources-for-live-coding-events","title":"Resources for Live Coding Events","text":"<ul> <li>https://toplap.cat/posts/alo/</li> <li>https://iclc.toplap.org/2025</li> <li>https://toplapbarcelona.hangar.org</li> </ul>"},{"location":"term2/materials/","title":"Living Materials","text":"<p>Course Details</p> <p>Name: Living Materials </p> <p>Dates: 15 January to 17 January 2025</p> <p>Faculty: Petra Garajov\u00e1</p>"},{"location":"term2/materials/#biomaterials-class","title":"Biomaterials Class","text":"<p>We started the workshop with a presentation about sustainability vs. regenerative practices and how bioplastics fit into these methodologies.

Unfortunately, I found this very frustrating and and struggled to get past the feeling that we had 'wasted' the first day trying to decide what to do. The project we eventually chose was something related to an investigation I was interested in from a previous intervention, though, so I was excited to get to explore it further.  </p> <p>The work itself that we did was interesting and we encountered many challenges throughout the process. We tried different processes related to which hardware we would use, either the Barduino or the Raspberry Pi. I struggled with the sense that we were redoing work, pivoting to a new system after already putting a full days work into one system. However, with some time since that frustration to reflect, I can recognize that this type of pivoting is all part of the process. </p> <p>Additionally, a challenge we encountered was that the project did not work in a few fundamental ways that made it difficult for me to feel satisfied about what we had achieved. I had a vision in my head about the scope of our project. My intention was to have a device that we could connect to a local wifi network and 'watch' a series of specific videos over the course of many days. Then we would be able to monitor the 'infection' of the network by seeing what content was suggested by the algorithms on our own devices and accounts. This theory was based on some experiences I have had of videos that a friend showed me on their device showing up on my device a few days later. However, during our prototyping phase, we were told that YouTube in particular has certain encryptions in place that would almost certainly make this theory not actually play out. I was determined to keep trying though, because even if it didn't work, that would be interesting insight as well. </p> <p>I started digging into the YouTube API to try to figure out how we could monitor suggested videos, however quickly realized that there are, in fact privacy protections in palace that limit what someone can see about their own account even. So, I transitioned over to an investigation about how to log information about the videos we were watching using the Google Sheet API. While we were unable to get any of the functionality we envisioned in working order, I did learn a bit about using APIs and was eventually able to find value in the project overall, despite it not being anything like what I had expected to be doing or being very related to I had wanted to investigate. </p> <p>Another point of frustration with this challenge was when our documentation on Hackster.io was deleted somehow by their servers. I have learned, now to have backups of the documentation in another place, perhaps on GitHub, so that work does not need to be repeated when things go wrong in ways beyond our control. </p> <p>Overall, this Micro Challenge was perhaps more mentally and emotionally challenging than technically challenging. While we encountered many technical challenges, working through my own frustrations was certainly the biggest challenge I had to tackle. However, looking back at it, I realize that I was able to learn useful skills, just not necessarily the ones I expected to learn. </p>"},{"location":"term2/microchallenge/#micro-challenge-ii","title":"Micro Challenge II","text":"<p>For the second Micro Challenge, I worked with Carlos Silveira and Flavio Grimaldi.</p> Micro Swarm GitHub Micro Swarm Hackster.io"},{"location":"term2/microchallenge/#reflection_1","title":"Reflection","text":"<p>For Micro Challenge II, I was determined to not spend an entire day trying to pick a project, so I joined a group who already had a clear idea of what they wanted to do, and set out to bring skills I wanted to learn into the project. I was interested in learning about communication protocols between devices and ideally to integrate MIDI and audio control into the project. While I barely scratched the surface of the communication protocols, I got a good first taste of the challenges that can arise with these kinds of systems. </p> <p>Additionally, through this project, I found myself more and more convinced that ChatGPT is only marginally helpful when it comes to writing code. I have always found it frustrating to attempt to understand someone else's code, especially when it is not documented very well, and I found this a challenge when trying to integrate the code my group members were writing into the code I had written. Because there was some dependence on generated code, it was challenging at times to follow the logic and to figure out how to integrate these codes together. However, at one point, I used ChatGPT, despite my protestations, to help me figure out the logic of a code piece I was struggling to write. So, overall, I can recognize that these tools have a place in coding workflows, if they are used carefully, consciously, and with context for what the resulting code is doing. </p> <p>This Micro Challenge still had significant moments of frustration when things did not come together as we had hoped. As usually, given the short time frame, we had to scale our ideas back significantly, and then scale them back again when time started to get tight. As with many of these sorts of projects, by the end it felt like if we'd had 'just one or two more days' we could have gotten it working better, however, part of the value of these short projects is to learn to be okay with things that are not complete, not meeting the vision. This is something I still struggle with. </p>"},{"location":"term2/situated/","title":"Situated Design Practices","text":"<p>Course Details</p> <p>Name: Situated Design Practices </p> <p>Dates: Various </p> <p>Faculty: Sa\u00fal Baeza</p>"},{"location":"term2/situated/#bike-trip-along-the-llobregat-river-to-cal-negre","title":"Bike trip along the Llobregat River to Cal Negre","text":"<p>Date</p> <p>13 January </p> \u276e \u276f"},{"location":"term2/situated/#session-with-hibai-harbidez-about-borders-and-forced-communities","title":"Session with Hibai Harbidez about Borders and Forced Communities","text":"<p>Date</p> <p>21 January </p>"},{"location":"term2/situated/#visit-to-jokkoo","title":"Visit to Jokkoo","text":"<p>Date</p> <p>11 February</p> \u276e \u276f"},{"location":"term2/situated/#session-with-ben-ditto-about-internet-subcultures","title":"Session with Ben Ditto about Internet Subcultures","text":"<p>Date</p> <p>18 February </p>"},{"location":"term2/situated/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":"<p>I have been struggling to find and define my community of impact for my interventions and projects. Most likely I have been fighting against my instincts to try to fit into a preconceived notion of what my community would or should be for this program. Additionally, I have been focusing my energy in too many directions to have a clearly defined project or focus that will allow me to find and connect with a local community of impact. Anxiety and fear has also kept me in my shell and not communicating with Barcelona communities who maybe could be a part of my community. </p> <p>So, to try to break out of my preconceived notions of my positioning and context, I will reflect on a community I am a part of personally and perhaps that can tie into my professional life as a designer in ways that I can leverage going forward, or at least that I can pull valuable information from. </p> <p>In my personal life, I am a part of a folk dance community that spreads across regions of the USA and around the world and spans generations while often staying rooted in similar political ideologies and identities. I have traveled to places like Stockholm, Berlin, and Glasgow and found people who speak a similar physical language as me, that of a shared appreciation of a particular style of dance. While this global network of people sharing an interest can give me a landing space in a new city I visit, the place where I most acutely feel the strength and value of this community is at Pinewoods Camp in Plymouth, Massachusetts, USA. This is a community I grew up in, from age four until I went to university and stepped away for a few years. While some of the faces have changed, some leaving the immediate periphery while many new faces have joined, the physical place and the shared activity of dancing beneath pine trees has remained a strong thread through most of my life. </p> <p>I feel that the multi-generational aspect of the community is an important part of this group. Much of the strength of the community comes from mixing people of different ages, with different generational perspectives, together into a dance pavilion where we share laughs, movement, and support. While ideologically many of the people involved in these spaces share a lot of similar identity traits - trending white, upper-middle class, liberal to an sometimes insular degree - there is diversity in life experience simply in terms of amount of life lived that creates a space for sharing support, advice, and ideas beyond of siloed age-specific groups. Hearing stories of camp long ago or sharing excitement with a younger person who is discovering something new for the first time is a magic that I find is so often missing from my non-folk dance life. </p> <p>When I first arrived in Barcelona, I went to a dance with a group that meets here in the city. They were welcoming and lovely, as I have gotten used to. The dancing was familiar and I had a great time. Then when I left, I found myself completely exhausted. The challenge of trying to communicate in Spanish while they spoke to each other in Catalan was a barrier that I did not anticipate having. Since the language of dance and movement so often transcends verbal communication barriers, I was not prepared for the struggles. This group fit the criteria of being multi-generational and yet somehow it did not feel comfortable in the way that I am used to. I did not immediately understand the social structure and how I fit in, as I have been accustomed to. Unfortunately, I have not gone back to the dance and have found myself getting more and more drawn into my language bubble as the months of being here have accumulated. I am finding myself daydreaming of comfort within the community I fit so easily into and struggling to engage with spaces here where I do not feel confident in my own position within the group. </p> <p>So, where does that leave me? How can I position myself given the context I come from, the context I am in, and the examples of situated communities we saw in this class? Where can I find my community of practice, my community of impact for the topics I want to explore? Have I been putting too much pressure on myself to connect with people here while failing to make connections that feel meaningful enough to frame my practice? Are these communities back in my home environment? If I choose to embrace the idea of my community of practice existing within a context where I am not physically located, what will that look like in terms of my design practice itself? If I choose to focus on communities where I already feel safe and secure, where I experience fun and support, am I missing an opportunity to find another such community here? Am I going to fundamentally change my relationship with those communities in a potentially negative or harmful way by trying to include them as part of my practice?</p> <p>To all these questions, I find myself answering with an 'I don't know'. I struggle to form connection online with people I don't yet know. I have never been interested in social media, even as a means of meeting people and connecting with creatives and potential collaborators. Perhaps I need to change that though, perhaps I need to embrace the idea that my community of practice may not be physically here in Barcelona or in Boston. Perhaps I need to get over the anxiety of putting myself out there on the internet while also putting myself out there in communities here where I am currently physically situated. Both of those options sound exhausting and overwhelming. I do not know how to dig deeper than I have with the communities I am attempting to become a part of here in Barcelona. If I were to make it back to the dancing, I would feel awkward trying to explain why I disappeared for five months, why my language skills have not improved, and why I do not know if I can commit to coming ever again. I feel guilt over not wanting to put in the work and am simultaneously struggling to allow myself to be okay with the fact that I may not ever go back. I am also struggling to figure out where I fit in the Restarters Barcelona. I have visited two Restart Parties and felt peripheral and uncertain about how I fit. These spaces too fit the multi-generational criteria and also have the language challenges I have encountered in the dance space. I have not gone back to either event and do not know if I will be able to get up the courage or willpower to do so again. </p> <p>So, once again, I have to ask, where does that leave me? How am I situating my design practice, how can I frame my community of impact? Once again, I am not sure I have an answer. Much of my work has been focused on myself, on the people within MDEF, and daydreams of 'one day' when I am back in a place I can feel confident and comfortable. I'm not sure how to give myself credit for what I have accomplished, it feels like I have accomplished little to nothing with a situated perspective, with any semblance of completion, with any community of practice. </p> <p>I suppose I will just keep trying and putting the effort I can in, trying to overcome anxiety, and staying in touch with communities back home to sustain myself in the meantime. </p>"},{"location":"term2/designStudio/design02WK01/","title":"Design Studio 02 - First Session","text":"<p>Course Details</p> <p>Name: Design Studio 02 - First Session </p> <p>Dates: 08 January 2025</p> <p>Faculty: Jana Tothill Calvo &amp; Roger Guilemany</p>"},{"location":"term2/designStudio/design02WK01/#design-space","title":"Design Space","text":"<p>The style of my design space changed when I was preparing for the Design Dialogue.

First and foremost, I am assuming that repair is 'good', that it reduces waste generation and production of new objects, which is in turn I am assuming, a good thing. I am assuming the waste produced when broken or old things are discarded is harmful to the environment, humans, and non-humans on our planet and that repair leads to less waste, reducing these problems. I am assuming that increasing access to and awareness of repair will help rather than hurt, creating a cultural shift that will not cause more suffering. The implicit assumption that repair is good, worthwhile, and helpful is baked into my project. </p> <p>During the development of this project, I am conscious of my positioning and do not want to overstep my place and context. I do not want to enter established repair spaces and expect to change things, to upend systems or communities that are functioning effectively with institutional knowledge. I do not want to disrupt existing structures, but instead, I hope to offer opportunities for opening more spaces to help more people be involved in repair communities. </p> <p>Additional assumptions I am making are that repair is ethical in how it treats human expertise and material goods. The expectation in this work is that people who are doing repairs are being treated ethically and are compensated according to their skills. I also am assuming that the material is being used carefully, thoughtfully, ethically, and is not being wasted or downgraded for the sake of repair. Additionally, I am proceeding under the assumption that repairs will not cause the repaired object to become more ecologically or economically problematic by adding material. These assumptions all depend on the repair being made, the skills, habits, and practices of the person or community doing the repair, and the available materials and resources. </p> <p>It is my intention with this project to source material from places that remove waste from garbage streams rather than create more. I do not want to reduce functioning items to scrap material all for the sake of a repair of something else. When possible, I will try to use material that has already been deemed at its end of life. For example, I have used fabric I found near a trash bin to create new items and fix my clothes. Even this presented a potential issue, though because it is possible that these clothes would have been picked up by people who collect usable materials and resell them here in Barcelona. By turning these pieces of clothing into patches for my jeans, dog toys to give as gifts, and a pair of slippers, did I inadvertently turn functioning clothes into materials that cause more waste? I would like to think that because these actions allowed me to not buy new, the net gain is positive, but because of the nature of the work I am trying to do, I am not sure how possible it is to measure that kind of impact and assess it. </p> <p>So, going forward, I will try to be thoughtful about my choices and actions. I will work to record possible alternative outcomes for objects I am using if I had not intervened. To track my own waste production from these repairs, I could gather all of the waste generated during the repairs, from pieces of thread to tiny fabric scraps. I already am fairly frugal when it comes to throwing out scraps, I save pieces of fabric and save pieces of thread that are long enough to use on another project. Unfortunately, knowing myself, I am prone to overthinking these things. If I become too vigilant with my tracking of waste, I fear that I will stop acting at all, stop repairing or creating, out of fear of making a worse impact by intervening than if I had not. It has to be a balance, I suppose. </p> <p>The ideal applications of this work are that people who engage with it become empowered to repair, to seek opportunities to learn repair skills, waste and purchase less, and spread their new cognizance about repair to others in a cascading effect. The ideal would be to show people the beauty of repair and the emotional value that can be added to objects by taking care to repair them. Possible deviations from my intended purpose are that in an effort to repair, people create more waste or turn functional objects into disposable materials which don't get used thoughtfully. Additionally, by providing access to repair skills and understanding, people who practice repair professionally, might find their skills being less in demand. This sort of shift would have to come with a massive cultural shift, though, so I do not anticipate that happening on a large scale from my small project. There are likely more possible deviations from my intent, however, these were the first that came to my mind when thinking about misuses of my project. </p>"},{"location":"term2/designStudio/design02WK03/#design-space","title":"Design Space","text":"<p>Updates to my Design Space. </p> Design Space"},{"location":"term2/designStudio/design02WK03/#reflection_1","title":"Reflection","text":"<p>Below is my audio reflection after my dance event and about what I took away from the event. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term2/designStudio/design02WK04/","title":"Design Studio 04 - Fourth Session","text":"<p>Course Details</p> <p>Name: Design Studio 04 - Fourth Session </p> <p>Dates: 17 February 2025</p> <p>Faculty: Jana Tothill Calvo &amp; Roger Guilemany</p>"},{"location":"term2/designStudio/design02WK04/#situated-intervention","title":"Situated Intervention","text":"<p>The intervention I completed for this week's investigation was not the most formal intervention, but more like getting started on a project and intervention I had been meaning to start for a long time. </p> <p>I have been having conversations about collaborating on a project with Penny Papachristodoulou of the collective La Pode del Raval.

When we met, we talked about integrating storytelling into our project. Particularly, Penny is interested in using repair as a metaphor for telling stories about people healing from trauma. While we are still in the early stages of figuring out what exactly what we will do together, we had great conversations about the possibilities. </p> <p></p> <p>We are planning to create some sort of installation or event to participate in Fashion Revolution which will give us a goal that is a few weeks after the Design Dialogues. My personal goal will be to have a prototype of the installation/event to test at the Design Dialogues on March 26th so that I can iterate on it for Fashion Revolution Week from April 22-27. </p> <p>Something I noticed during my discussions with Penny about integrating mending with circuits is how remarkably similar the darning patch looks to an integrated circuit chip. While I do not yet know how this may relate to the narrative I am building around this project, I find the similarity interesting and worth noting. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>So, for this intervention, I did a few different projects working on my own mending skills and testing out a basic system to integrate electronics into the mending pattern. </p>"},{"location":"term2/designStudio/design02WK04/#woven-mending-test","title":"Woven Mending Test","text":"<p>First, I experimented with the woven darning technique by mending my classmate's jeans.

Additionally, the thread does not feel stretchy at all, so I decided to try making a patch instead and using the pressure sensors we made in the H(n)MI class to vary the LED brightness based on how much pressure is applied to path. </p> \u276e \u276f <p>The final result is a patch that has 3 LEDs connected to it which vary in brightness with the pressure applied to the conductors in the woven patch. As a first test to see if the pressure sensor works with this method of mending, I would say it is a success.

This will require attaching the circuit to the Barduino analog pins which may require some slight reworking of the stitching. </p> <p>Additionally, next steps will include trying this method out on an actual ripped fabric as a mending method. It may complicate the pattern more to not be using the cross-stitch grid to keep everything square.

During the workshop, I had developed a game to try to spark creative conversation about repair. It is a collaborative game about repairing things with somewhat strange, silly, or limited tools, materials, and skills. The purpose of this game is to get people laughing and talking about repair through ideating about creative ways to fix things, from a broken plate to society and many things in between. </p> <p> </p> <p>The first prototype of the game, during the class was a very simple, hand written version. The rules were vague, it needed a lot of work-shopping. At first, my idea had been to try to be very practical, only including things that I felt could really be fixed. However, the teacher for the seminar liked the idea of including a variety of things, especially things that fall more into the wicked problems category, to keep the game extra interesting. </p> <p>The first round of printed cards included some of the more challenging \"broken items\". This was the version of the game I showcased at the Elisava workshop show case. I had play tested the game only a few times at that point and had the opportunity to play test it once more. Without having the rules fully locked down nor written out at the time, I was able to adapt quickly and try different options. The teacher had suggested including a board so make clear how the other cards 'attach' to the \"broken item\". I did not have the chance to print one out, so I hand drew one for the occasion. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>All of this was done well before the fifth session of Design Studio, so what follows is the actual work I did for this portion of the Design Studio. </p>"},{"location":"term2/designStudio/design02WK05/#iteration-and-intervention","title":"Iteration and Intervention","text":"<p>I wanted to test this game to see if it is a useful tool for getting others interested in the ideas of repair, or at least discussion with friends the possibilities. First, I had to make sure the game was actually playable, made sense, was at least a little bit fun, and had been tested a few times. </p> <p>The first step in this process was coming up with actual rules, testing them, and then iterating on them with the help of my classmates. I played the game with a few friends who suggested things to help make it more engaging.</p> Repair Party! Rules <p>Welcome to the Repair Party, we have many broken items that need to be fixed and we need your help to do that. </p> <p>You will need to work together with your group of repairers using Skills, Tools, and Materials to fix as many items as you can before time runs out.</p> <p>Setup the Game</p> <p>Build the Decks</p> <ul> <li>Sort the Broken Item and Temporary Fix Cards out of the deck and shuffle remaining (Skill, Tool, and Material) cards together to form the Repair Deck. </li> <li>Shuffle the Broken Item Cards and place them face down to form the Item Deck. </li> <li>Place the Temporary Fix Cards off to the side, face up. </li> </ul> <p>Prepare to Play</p> <ul> <li>Deal 3 cards from the Repair Deck to each player. </li> <li>Determine who is wearing the most repaired or second hand clothes in your group - they will take their turn first. </li> <li>Prepare for a number of rounds equal to the number of players + 1.  (Ex. 3 players will have 4 rounds)</li> <li>Get ready for repairing chaos!</li> </ul> <p>Play the Game</p> <p>Flip over the first 2 cards from the Item Deck and start with the first player. </p> <p>Actions:</p> <p>Until the rounds run out, each player can do any of the following actions on their turn. </p> <ul> <li>Play a Card: From your hand, place a Skill, Tool, or Material Card on one of the in-play Broken Item Cards. This card must be something you think can be used to fix the Broken Item you are playing it on. Then draw a new Card from the Repair Deck.</li> <li>Move a Card: Move a card from one Broken Item to another. Place a Temporary Fix on the moved card\u2019s spot.</li> <li>Play a Temporary Fix: Place a Temporary Fix on a Broken Item if there are no usable cards are in your hand. Do not draw a new card. The next player remove it on their turn.</li> <li>Remove a Temporary Fix: Replace a Temporary Fix card with one from your hand, or play another Temporary Fix if no card fits. Both fixes must be removed before drawing a new card.</li> <li>Complete a Repair: If a Broken Item has a Skill, Tool, and Material Card, explain a plausible repair story of how the item was fixed. If the group approves, remove the item and cards, score a point, flip over another Broken Item Card and pass play to the next player. </li> </ul> <p>Winning the Game</p> <p>Your team of repairers wins the game if the number of repairs completed within the number of rounds equal to the number of players in your team + 1. If the stories told about the repairs are hilarious, far-fetched, or ridiculous, all the better, but make sure you are justifying them clearly and that the whole group agrees they are valid. </p> <p>Losing the Game</p> <p>Your team of repairers loses the game if you do not complete the number of repairs within the round limit.  Additionally, if you have played all of the Temporary Fix Cards and do not replace the last card with a card from your hand, your team loses. Unfortunately in this scenario, you have fixed too many things with temporary fixes and the whole Repair Party comes crashing to the ground.</p> <p>In my mind, the game is mostly an ideation tool, something to get people talking. The intended audience is perhaps people at a workshop about repair, maybe as an ice breaker. However, if it were interesting enough, it could be interesting to try making it a bit more like a traditional game, unfortunately, it is not at that point yet. There is still a long way to go. </p> <p>I wanted to use the game for the Work in Progress presentation at Elisava, and so I created a few more cards, printed the rules, and made a box for the game to make it more presentable. To make the box, I initially tried laser cutting a large cardboard box I had found next to a garbage bin and walked with to school. The laser cut didn't work out correctly though, so I ended up making the box the old fashioned way: with a straightedge, box cutter, ruler, and glue. It is not the most polished outcome, but it felt very me in a way. </p> <p> </p> <p>At the Work in Progress showcase, I was able to get a few people to play the game. I am not sure they found it as engaging as I had hoped, but it wasn't really the correct environment for it as I had very little time to explain how it works, they had other projects to look at, and they were only mildly interested anyway. Still, it was useful to get people's reactions to it. </p> <p>The real intervention with this game is yet to come. I have not pursued the chance to test it with repairers or with people involved in a repair workshop. Many people who have spoken to me have asked the purpose of the game, what I am aiming to achieve with it. Upon reflection, I think using it as an ice breaker at a workshop is probably the best place to start. Get people laughing and talking about repair with a simple game. Start a conversation about how we can potentially fix some small broken things and to get whimsical and creative about how we might be able to fix larger, more challenging things. I hope to test this game in that kind of setting soon, and to collect more feedback about it as well. </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"term2/designStudio/design02WK05/#reflection-on-transition-design-talk","title":"Reflection on Transition Design Talk","text":""},{"location":"term2/designStudio/design02WK05/#mapping-the-landscape","title":"Mapping the Landscape","text":"<p>Mapping the landscape about repair feels like it is reiterating on my design space, but with a more external look than I have previously had.

We also live in a world that has a lot of goodness and beauty, which can be hard to remember. In a world rushing towards climate catastrophe perpetrated by over-consumption, over-production, and massive amounts of waste, all driven by the constant drive for growth, finding pockets of hope may be a constant struggle. The climate emergency on its own would be enough for someone to lose that hope, but there are also so many other crises, from regional conflicts, resource inequalities, and loss of community support, to the tension between numbing ourselves to the suffering and bombarding ourselves with information specifically chosen by algorithms to keep us in a state of panic, despair, and division. So, dear reader, in the midst of all that, I hope you are able to intentionally focus smaller, on yourself and your community and the small impacts you can make to elevate the goodness that exists and to repair what you can. </p> <p>When I try to think about these things, I start with asking myself questions. So, for you, I will do the same. Where can we put our energy in this moment to supports us in keeping the hope alive, so that we can sustain the journey through the beautiful, messy adventure we call life? What actions can we take to foster kindness and support in our communities? The world is too big to address it all, so what can we do to have a meaningful, local impact? What existing efforts can be amplify?</p> <p>Even these questions are maybe too big.I have found myself getting lost in them, getting stuck.

Perhaps this map can guide both of us in our attempts to respond to the world\u2019s challenges. </p> <p>So, dear reader, I hope this letter finds you well and if you choose to take up the mantel of adventurer on the journey with me, I hope that it reminds you to pause, take a deep breath, step back to examine your path. Take a look at where you have come from, where you are, where you are going, and who you are inviting to join you. </p> <p>I hope to have you along on my journey, adventurer, and I look forward to hearing about your endeavor if you are able to write me back. </p> <p>All the best, </p> <p>Lucretia Field </p>"},{"location":"term2/designStudio/termEnd/#the-text-of-the-supplemental-letters","title":"The text of the supplemental letters:","text":"Find Your Community <p>Dear Reader, </p> <p>You are going to need support on this journey. If you are in a place where you have community, then you are already many steps ahead of where I was not long ago. This portion of my adventure began when I uprooted myself and moved to a place where I knew no one, struggle to speak the language, and had new habits and cultures to learn. I found that very hard and continue to struggle, but am making progress. So, dear reader, you will need to find your community or those who can support you along the path. </p> <p>I suggest you start by finding someone who can connect you with someone who is on a journey tangential to yours. The trick then, is to have the courage to more deeply engage. It may be scary, but committing to making a strong connection is valuable and they can likely connect you to others. </p> <p>Include this growing group in your adventure. Keeping them informed may feel like boasting, but most likely they are interested and may be able to provide you resources and support along the way. </p> Dance a bit more <p>Dear Reader, </p> <p>Sometimes you will need to rest and unwind with a side quest - it might be of greater significance than you thought at first. Sometimes you have to just enjoy what the world has to offer - to shift focus to embracing the music of it all. Sometimes you gotta throw off the worries and just dance. Sometimes I lose the habit of dancing, distracted by the possibilities of a new adventure or overwhelmed by the things I am trying to do, at those times, I seek opportunities to reengage with the dance. </p> <p>So, dear reader, this is your reminder to take breaks from the adventure to participate in what brings your soul joy. </p> <p>Take the time to dance. Quiet your thoughts and just move to music. Move with others. Once you are refreshed, try to look at things from a new perspective. Examine old patterns in new ways, with skills you\u2019ve picked up on your journey and those you began equipped with. </p> <p>Bring the excitement, joy, fluidity and music back into your practice, even if it feels tangential, it is likely more foundational than you think. </p> Simplify your solutions <p>Dear Reader, </p> <p>You may, like me, often get caught up in the idea that you can change the world, that you can solve all the problems, that in a short amount of time you will be able to accomplish grand goals. At the beginning of our journey we were interested in focusing smaller, with yourself and local impact. So you will need to embrace small steps, they are as valuable as large ones. Things may not always feel complete or \u201cgood enough\u201d and that is okay. This is an ongoing journey building upon itself and returning home often. </p> <p>For me, dear reader, this has meant coming to terms with simplifying my ideas again and again. From a grand idea of collecting solar energy to extend my phone battery, I turned to a practice of care and habit changes. From an ambitious plan to test my networking skills, I settled for a basic prototype. These small adventures reminded me that a step along a path is valuable no matter how small it appears. Sometimes the smaller, less complex steps are even more valuable than the large leaps would be. </p> <p>Dear adventurer, please remember to simplify. You are capable of great things, but they require small steps and consistent progress not giant bounds. </p> Redefine your goals &amp; next steps <p>Dear Reader,</p> <p>By now in your journey, you may be feeling confused, overwhelmed, or lost. Tune into the feeling of being lost, if you can. Sometimes following the confusion can lead you to another path. If you need a pause, please take one, please rest in the confusion and discomfort, but don\u2019t get stuck there. You may fear you have lost the path, but the truth, dear reader, is there is that there is never only one path. It may be scary to remember, but you choose where you go. Perhaps you will make your own path. Please just remember that while the possibilities are endless, you only need to look at a cluster that might suit you. </p> <p>If you are not stuck in confusion at this point, perhaps you are feeling inspired to run off in many different directions all at once. This is a very exciting! Please be sure to save enough energy and provisions to make it back home though. Focus on a task, a purpose, a single investigation can be valuable, but so can a scavenger hunt that runs around all over the place. I simply caution you to remember to pause and reflect on these new horizons. Explore and learn, do and create, test and experiment, but remember to take a deep breath and a moment of reflection. </p> <p>So, when it comes time, redefine your trajectory and begin again.

The goal was to create an interactive object that would be important for our activation during the festival.

The goal was to end the week with an interactive laptop that had both the 'trackpad' and the 'screen' elements completed so that it was recognizable as a laptop. </p> <p>The result form the week did not completely live up to these expectations, as is apparent from the Hackster.io documentation below, but it was a good chance to make more progress on the project overall. </p> MDEF Final Project GitHub Mend your Laptop Hackster.io"},{"location":"term3/microchallenge/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":"<p>As with the other micro challenges, I had the opportunity, once again, to learn that everything takes longer than you expect it will when making. I started with a pretty clear plan of what I wanted to accomplish during the challenge and almost immediately ran into problems meeting those goals. </p> <p>I defined a few Key Performance Indicators as was assigned in preparation for the start of the challenge. </p> <ul> <li>Ecosystem Integration: Can someone write a short explanation of the purpose of the project, including the repair and anti-productivity messages, that shows their understanding of the system overall?</li> <li>Data &amp; Feedback Loops: Does the artifact respond to input from the user and output a response? - Touch of trackpad = lights LEDs and creates sounds</li> <li>Making &amp; Materiality: Does the laptop use more than 75% old/discarded materials? Does it embody the ideas of 'repair' even while not making the objects functional in their original way?</li> <li>Intelligences: Does someone know how to interact with the object without an explanation of what it is or how it works or why?</li> <li>Sensor Interfact: Does it look like a laptop in a recognizable way?</li> </ul> <p>While I feel I fell short of many of these, by defining them, I at least acknowledged my own ambition. I had hoped to have the laptop together in a recognizable way by the end of the challenge, with a 'screen' that responded visually to the touches on the 'trackpad'. Instead, by the end, I had a half functioning 'trackpad' that creates a visual response with LEDs and some sounds when pressed in certain places. All of this is still on a breadboard, still outside of the laptop case the way I had envisioned it. However, I did make progress that I would not have were we not given a week dedicated to working on our artifact. </p> <p>Also during the week, I started trying to figure out the specific logistics of my activation during the MDEFest itself. I have gone through many iterations of my ideas for the festival itself. As so often happens when projects take longer than one had hoped, the plans likely will have to change as reality makes it clear that the ambitions I had of making many different objects likely will not play out.</p>"},{"location":"term3/researchTrip/","title":"Research Trip","text":"<p>Course Details</p> <p>Name: Research Trip </p> <p>Dates: </p> <p>Faculty: </p>"},{"location":"term3/designStudio/design03WK01/","title":"Design Studio 03 - First Session","text":"<p>Course Details</p> <p>Name: Design Studio 03 - First Session </p> <p>Dates: 28 April 2025</p> <p>Faculty: Roger Guilemany</p>"},{"location":"term3/designStudio/design03WK01/#design-space","title":"Design Space","text":"Design Space"},{"location":"term3/designStudio/design03WK01/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":"<p>Below is my audio reflection at the start of the third term of MDEF.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term3/designStudio/design03WK02/","title":"Design Studio 03 - Second Session","text":"<p>Course Details</p> <p>Name: Design Studio 03 - Second Session </p> <p>Dates: 12 May 2025</p> <p>Faculty: Roger Guilemany with guests</p>"},{"location":"term3/designStudio/design03WK02/#sustainability-roadmap","title":"Sustainability Roadmap","text":"<p>Make sure to reflect on how the dimensions we explored  \u2013 Research-based - Product-based - Community-based projects</p>"},{"location":"term3/designStudio/design03WK02/#design-space","title":"Design Space","text":"<p>Updates to my Design Space to include the community and contacts I am starting to make here in Barcelona and some of those back home as well. </p>"},{"location":"term3/designStudio/design03WK02/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":"<p>Notes: Reflect on potential sustainability strategies for your Design Vision and desired Professional Identity.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"term3/designStudio/design03WK03/","title":"Design Studio 03 - Third Session","text":"<p>Course Details</p> <p>Name: Design Studio 03 - Third Session </p> <p>Dates: 29 May 2025</p> <p>Faculty: Roger Guilemany with Ane Guerra </p>"},{"location":"term3/designStudio/design03WK03/#story-telling-abstract","title":"Story Telling Abstract","text":"<p>Dear Reader, </p> <p>Have you ever marveled at the amount of clothing in the trash on your street? Have you ever noticed a discarded television that has been smashed to pieces? Have you ever picked these items up? </p> <p>I do. </p> <p>It pains me to see these items discarded, often still usable or with many usable parts. I create new objects out of them that go to the illogical extreme of radical reuse. I take discarded clothing and consumer electronics and transform them into objects from another reality; where computers have cloth screens and woven trackpads, and jeans have butt patches that light up. In an effort to reuse everything, purpose and function are transformed and the results are ridiculous. </p> <p>But how absurd really is this in a world where, the United Nations reports, 62 billion kgs of e-waste were generated in 2022? How absurd is inviting laughter at these \u2018solutions\u2019 when according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the equivalent of a truck full of clothing waste is burned or buried every second? </p> <p>The ideal is to actually fix our items so that they can be used for longer. Community repair efforts from Restart Parties, Repair Cafes, Mend in Public Days, to individual repair efforts are a place to start addressing these practical problems and deepening our connection to the objects that occupy our lives. However, when repair is not even an option in our collective thoughts, when we face external pressure from advisements and social judgements, why not embrace the weird? </p> <p>Dear reader, what weird will you embrace? Will you join me in the strange world I imagine? Start mending your clothes with broken electronics and your electronics with cloth and thread? Or, will you try your hand at repairing your clothes in a more traditional manner? Will you find a community to help you fix the fan that stopped working last summer? Can you keep your smartphone for just one year longer? Will you begin to brag about how old your items are, because really, it\u2019s absurd that we don\u2019t view the longevity of our objects as a personal achievement. </p> <p>I hope you will join me in this world of Darned Circuits where I imagine a world on the opposite extreme, and perhaps, we can start conversations with those still stuck in reality, so that we can meet in the middle. </p> <p>All the best,  Lucretia Field </p>"},{"location":"term3/designStudio/design03WK03/#design-space","title":"Design Space","text":"<p>Updates to my Design Space although I have not been as engaged with my design space in quite a while. </p>"},{"location":"term3/designStudio/design03WK03/#reflection","title":"Reflection","text":""}]}
